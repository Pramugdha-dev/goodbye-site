        <h2>Our English & Value Education Teacher</h2>

        <p>
            Thank you for being much more than just our English teacher. From explaining grammar rules 
            so clearly that even the most confusing ones finally made sense, to bringing literature 
            stories to life with your expressions and examples, your classes were never boring.  
            You were never too strict, always ready with a smile, a joke, or a fun comment that made 
            the classroom feel lighter.  
            Your creative projects, value education lessons, and those suddenly tricky viva questions 
            kept us alert and thinking. You always believed in us, cared for us, and made learning feel 
            meaningful. As we move to Class 9, we carry your lessons, laughter, and kindness with us.  
            We will truly miss you.
        </p>
